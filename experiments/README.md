# Experiments Directory

## What's in here:
- `docker-compose-persistent.yml` - Better volume persistence setup
- `docker-compose-hacked.yml` - Init container workaround 
- `coolify-deploy.sh` - API deployment script
- `Dockerfile.coolify-hack` - Multi-stage build approach
- `bypass-coolify.yml` - Traefik setup to skip Coolify entirely
- `PLATFORM-ISSUES.md` - Documentation of all the pain

## Status:
Created on Sunday evening when sanity was low and the desire to clean up tech debt was even lower.

## Future plans:
Maybe look at these someday when it's not the weekend. Or when Coolify breaks again. Whichever comes first.

## Note to future self:
The current setup with GitHub downloads actually works. Don't fix what ain't broken unless you have a really good reason (and coffee).
